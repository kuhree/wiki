Hi, I'm Khari (kuhree) Johnson.

You're on this page to learn more about me, so let's start with the story.

## Backstory

### From the beginning,

I've been a nerd. Sometime in elementary school, my mother had a graveyard of computers that had died from various reasons while working (7+). I tried to Frankenstein these into a working system that I could use as my own. I never got it to work but I learned a valuable lesson, the inside of computers are nothing special, nothing to be afraid of and quite challening and engaging to work with.

Of course, I had no idea what I was doing at the time. I didn't know the CPU from the RAM or a HDD from a USB Stick. All I was concerned with is pieces that seemed like they fit together.

A couple years later, my brother gifted me a laptop that he had forgotten the password to. Through endless googling and learning about something called the terminal, I failed to crack/reset the password. BUT I did learn that you can wipe the drive and install Windows again.

A couple years later, a friend of the family had "rooted" my mother's android phone. I didn't know what this meant but it allowed her access to apps and perks that weren't available before.

There are many more instances like this as a young child. I didn't just love tech though. I fell in love with sports, art and stories, video games and just living a good life.

### Sometime later

After spending a few years in different rabbit holes I was introduced to coding. We spent a year moving little robots on the screen and that was all it took for me to fall in love.

## The Start

Of my professional career was a long one. I had coded side projects and various utilities for friends and families over the years. This resulted in a very product focused mindset when it comes to software. Software that solves real peoples real problems.

Anyways, I started in freelancing and contract work. This is _not_ my recommended way into the industry. I learned a lot over the years, working with various teams of various sizes and many different kinds of projects.

I was able to hone in on a wide set of skills that has carried me to where I am today.

Taking a moment to say that I don't recommend this path _into_ the industry. It took a _while_ to get going but once it starts it's hard to stop.

It wasn't all pretty. There are failed projects, clients ghosting, taxes, legal… I didn't learn the hard lessons until it was too late.

I left the freelance / contract scene a burnt-out shell of my former self.
