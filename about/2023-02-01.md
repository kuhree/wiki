## Introduction

Inspired my [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com), [Polly Washburn](https://codyssia.com),
and a few other developers that I've seen do something similar; I've decided to start a series of notes tagged `#changelog`. This allows for a few things:

- gives me a place to share things that aren't focused enough to warrant a blog notes
- holds me accountable for some of the things I'd like to track

## Updates

### ChatGPT

I, like [a lot of people](chatgpt-userbase-record), have been [tinkering with ChatGPT](/blogging-with-chatgpt) and trying to find it's strengths and weaknesses.

It's been a great time and I've enjoyed learning the intricacies of AI and neural networks.

### Reading

I haven't sat down to read a full book in around 3-4 years now. That's sad to me.

I read a _lot_ on the web, but it's just not the same.

### Running

I've been run an avid runner since elementary school.
I've 100% fell out of the habit, but there's this "itch" to run that keeps coming back.

### Work

I've been on the job search for about a month now. It's been rough, yet rewarding at the same time.
