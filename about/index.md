## Software Engineer

I'm a software engineer with a passion for:

- Solving challenging technical problems
- Building and automating solutions
- Sharing knowledge and results
- Living a balanced life

## Beyond Code

When I'm not programming, you might find me:

- Gaming and exploring virtual worlds
- Tinkering with hardware and DIY projects
- Diving deep into whatever has caught my curiosity
- Taking [photos][gallery] and exploring new places

## The Journey

My fascination with technology started early. As a kid, I attempted to build a computer from spare parts in my mother's tech graveyard. While that first build never powered on, it taught me that computers weren't magical black boxes - they were systems that could be understood and mastered.

This curiosity led me through various tech adventures:
- Discovering how to reinstall operating systems
- Learning about Android rooting and customization
- Building small utilities for family and friends
- Eventually finding my way to programming

## Professional Path

My career began in freelancing and contract work. While this path taught me valuable lessons about building real solutions for real people, it came with its challenges. I worked with teams of all sizes, on diverse projects, and developed a broad technical skillset.

Today, I focus on:

- Frontend development [TypeScript][ts], [React][react], and other web technologies
- Backend systems in [Node.js][node] and [Go][go]
- Database design with [SQLite][sqlite] and [Postgres][postgres]
- DevOps practices using [Docker][docker] and [GitHub Actions][gh-actions]
