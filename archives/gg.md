GG is a "(G)o (G)ame Engine". I wanted to

- learn more about the terminal
- understand how games "loop"
	- sidenote, 16ms time to process is â€¦ kinda nice in a "force me to simplify", but also not in a "you can always go higher, but it's so much harder to come down" way
- use a little more [[go|Go]]

Here are some screenshots
