## Intro

[GoLang](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google\[14\] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with

- [memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety)
- [garbage collection](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)
- [structural typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system)
- [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)\-style [concurrency](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)>). The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name
- [golang.org](http://golang.org/), but the proper name is Go.

- [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>)

It was designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson to improve productivity with a focus on

- Static Typing and runtime efficiency (like C)
- Readability and Usability (like Python or JS)
- High performance networking and multiprocessing
