Lf has a nice file preview feature, but it needs some work.

Currently following/watching a couple guides to see what's up.

The trick is to use pistol. Makes everything just easy in this case.

Install pistol and deps:

```txt
dnf install file-devel # installs libmagic from the file dev pkg
go install github.com/doronbehar/pistol/cmd/pistol@latest
```
