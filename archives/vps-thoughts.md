I've been selfhosting everything locally for a while now. I have some services that I think could benefit from being on a public vps for a couple of different reasons.

Some things are kinda critical. It would be nice to have a 99.99% SLA attached to the machine running it.

I could run a lot of my smaller side-projects and expiriments on one vps
