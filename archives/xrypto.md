## Xrypto

A Node.Js bot trained to buy and sell crypto based on a given strategy.

### Summary

Cryptode is an automated trading bot designed to buy and sell cryptocurrencies (tbd) based on a specified strategy (tbd).

### Introduction

Having worked with React exclusively for the past two years, I've found myself wanting to dive deeper into backend work. My latest, project Shrt, could use some backend help as well. I recently found out that you can automate trading and I found this [series](https://www.education-ecosystem.com/elliottminns/lK6rL-how-to-build-advanced-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-in-nodejs/Jp5yE-intro-video/) doing exactly that.

In this document I'll be following along with Eliott's course and attraching my own spin to suit my needs.
