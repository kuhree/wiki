so here's the thing. I've now lived long enough to become the evil I sought to destroy.

I am the bloat at this point.

I work on more OSs than I can remember or keep up with.

Scripts are everywhere, hard to manage/update/find and run them when I need to.

I've said "yes" to too many tools and technologies. Now I don't know how anything works, it's all a very serious mess and I'm tired.

I actually think it's causing slight psychosis.

So anyway, here's to saying "no", to simplifying, and to rejecting the tricknology I've been sold on.

## Workflow

I'll start with the workflow so I can work backwards.

In my work and personal life, I do a lot of development in various languages and many different projects.

Generally, I rely on docker to resolve dependency issues (lately, I've been interested in more [[nix]] and [[nixos]]).
