## Intro

Alright, so I've been running [[nixos]] on my personal laptop for the last couple months. I'm feeling familiar enough with its syntax. It'sâ€¦ okay. I do love the declarative nature, but there are definitely some rough edges. Specifically, documentation and debugging.

I once saw someone say that NixOS is for those that don't know how to keep a linux system running. I don't think that's true at all. I'd say it's easier to just install some gnome-flavor or debian. Hell, Arch was easier than this stuff.

Anyways, I'm not migrating my main mac machine to nix-darwin. Here's how it went.

## Setup

I'm on a 2019 Intel Macbook Pro with 16GB of RAM and a not so good battery.

I currently use homebrew to manage my packages and have an ansible task responsible for installing and upgrading packages on all my macs. This is nice, it works well enough.

I've never liked homebrew as a package manager. It's come a long way in the last few years specifically.
