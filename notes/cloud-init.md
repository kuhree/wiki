> password
> The password for the new user, encrypted. This is required for use with sudo, even if SSH access is configured.
> The encrypted password string must conform to what the passwd command requires. See the passwd(1) manual page for details. Quote the password hash to ensure correct treatment of any special characters.
> Several tools can generate the encrypted password, such as mkpasswd from the `whois` package, or `openssl passw`
