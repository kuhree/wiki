## The Eudaimonia Machine

### Imagine a co-working space built for maximum flow, original invention, and empowering culture.

A place where you can shut off all distractions and dive deep into a problem, as well as sweep yourself up in a whirlwind of collaborative work.

In Cal Newport’s _Deep Work_, we meet architecture professor David Dewane, who designed such a place. He called it the **Eudaimonia Machine**. [^4]

The Eudaimonia Machine's linear stages include:

- **The Gallery** - where we are inspired by previous examples of deep work in  
    our business
- **The Salon** - a collaborative hub where we share and debate ideas
- **The Library** - the store of all work ever done in our business; where we gather information for new projects
- **The Office Space** - a place where we can do shallow work: low intensity, high-admin activities; a place where there are often many distractions
- **The Chamber** - this space allows for total focus and uninterrupted work, where great value is added through deep work

## How do we implement this in our home?

- Bedroom/Entrance -> Gallery
- Dining Room -> Salon
- Living Room -> Library
- ??? -> Office
- ??? -> Chamber
