## Introduction

What if you could take back control of your data, your services, and your development environment—all while building new skills and maybe even saving some money?

For me, the journey began as an attempt to step away from the "cloud"—someone else's servers—and reclaim ownership of my data and daily services like email, calendars, file storage, and media streaming. This was around the time Google Workspace was hiking prices and tweaking plans, 'Killed by Google' was trending regularly on Twitter, and news of data breaches seemed endless. I am tired of blindly trusting big companies with my data and dealing with the fallout.

Owning your data is only the beginning. A homelab opens up endless possibilities: hosting your own streaming services, running secure file storage for sensitive notes, even offloading development tasks.

Setting up my homelab gave me a newfound sense of control, security, and freedom. It’s a space I own, manage, and modify as I see fit—something every developer deserves to experience. If you’ve been considering one but haven’t started yet, let me share why it’s worth it and how you can get started.

## What is a Homelab?

Okay, enough rambling--what even is a homelab?

It seems like such a simple question, but there's no right answer here. A homelab can mean many different things to different people. Still, you'll notice a few common traits when you start to look closer:

- They're not used for **production**
- They're easy to test new ideas and iterate on existing ones

In my experience, it’s easier to explain what a homelab isn’t before trying to define what it _is_.

A homelab isn’t **critical**. If it goes down, no one dies, no one loses significant money, and nothing catastrophic happens. Outside of that, almost anything can qualify as a "home" "lab." It’s all about experimentation, learning, and pushing boundaries on your own terms.

### Components

My homelab journey began with old Windows laptops and Raspberry Pis around 2013. I wanted to offload downloads to free up my desktop for gaming. It didn’t work as expected, but I learned a lot about bandwidth that week!

Today, my setup includes last-gen gaming PCs and second-hand networking equipment—admittedly overkill for my needs. But with AI workloads creeping into my projects, having extra power is becoming essential.

Getting started is simpler than it seems. All you need is one computer—an old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or even a mini PC. The key is owning the hardware and tinkering freely to learn and grow.

### Use Cases

1. **Git Hosting**

Every line of code I write lives in a Git repository synced to my self-hosted Gitea instance. This setup gives me total control and peace of mind. No corporate policy changes, no limits on private repos—just the freedom to work as I please.

A few years ago, Microsoft acquired GitHub and many developer (myself included) freaked out. I switched to GitLab and eventually made my way back to Github. With my homelab, I’m no longer at the mercy of external platforms, relying only on the hardware I own and how far I can push it.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Testing:**

If you’ve ever been stuck in the 'change-push-watch CI' loop, you know how tedious it can be—especially when adjusting pipelines. Running CI locally is one option, but my 2019 Intel MacBook Pro didn't appreciate the extra workload.

Now, I offload these tasks to a much more powerful server in my homelab. It runs cooler, faster, and even pings me when jobs are done. No lag, no frustration, just seamless testing and iteration.

3. **Photo and File Hosting:**

I’ve always loved the convenience of Google Drive/Photos. Throw in a bunch of files, access them from anywhere. But when my storage needs hit 2-4TB, the costs skyrocketed. As a broke twenty-something, I needed something better.

Now, I’ve recreated that workflow on my own hardware. I have access to originals, backups, and even compressed copies, all for a fraction of the cost. I spend about $50-100 per year on storage upgrades on average, compared to hundreds with cloud services.

## Benefits of Having a Homelab

A homelab is more than just a technical playground—it’s a space to grow, experiment, and push your skills to their limits. It’s a free environment to explore new possibilities without the risks of impacting production systems. Here are a few more reasons you might consider building one:

- **Hands-on Learning**: If you’re like me, the best way to learn is by doing. A homelab offers the perfect opportunity to get your hands dirty in a risk-free environment. Whether you’re configuring servers, testing software, or simulating network setups, every mistake is a chance to learn—and the stakes are entirely in your control.
- **Portfolio Building**: As a developer, your homelab is more than just a tool—it’s a conversation starter. Whether you’re at a networking event or in an interview, showcasing the projects you’ve built in your homelab demonstrates initiative, problem-solving skills, and technical curiosity. It’s an impressive way to make your work stand out.
- **Cost**: Running a homelab doesn’t have to break the bank. In fact, it could save you money in the long run. If you already have old hardware lying around—like a retired laptop or an unused Raspberry Pi—you’re halfway there. And compared to the recurring costs of cloud services, a homelab pays for itself over time.

A homelab isn’t just about technology—it’s about growth, discovery, and continuous learning. It’s a place to hone your craft, explore uncharted ideas, and challenge yourself. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned developer, a homelab is your personal space to experiment, innovate, and see what else is possible.

## How to setup a Homelab

1. Start small

You don't need to break the bank to start. Unless you know exactly what you want to run, your needs will evolve as you grow. Start small with what you have--an old laptop, a mini PC, or even a cloud VM if you're comfortable. Focus on understanding what each piece does and how it fits in the bigger picture.

2. Basic Tools and Equipment

At it's core, a homelab needs only one thing: a computer. You don't _need_ the latest and greatest, but try to avoid machines that are too outdated (e.g. 20+ years old). Here's why:

- Upgrading can be expensive. Once you've maxed out your current hardware, upgrading can be costly and restrictive. I found that hardware from the last 3-5 generations are usually the sweet spot in price and performance.
- Efficiency. Electricity and silence is not free. Older machines tend to be less power efficient and noisier, with louder fans and higher electricity usage. Modern tech generally strikes a better balance between performance, noise, and energy consumption.

Other than that, you may pick up one or multiple of the following depending on your needs.

- Virtualization/Containers: Split your workloads into isolated environments using tools like VMWare, Virtualbox, or Proxmox. For more lightweight/scalable processes, consider containers with LXC/Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Networking Gear: I assume that you have an Internet Service Provider and that they gave you a little box for you to connect to. This works for 99.9% of people and is just fine. However, if you're wanting a bit more control, you can always add your own gear in between or in-place of the ISP's modem/router to help you create a robust and customizable setup.

3. Get Started

Once you've got all the hardware and infrastructure in place, it's time to start running services. If you're not sure what to run, here are a few ideas to get your started

- Install a VPN like Tailscale or Wireguard so you can access the services from anywhere.
- Set up file sharing such has Nextcloud or Syncthing to sync and access your filed from anywhere

Starting with just a few services will help you to understand your setup and build confidence in making changes.

4. Scaling Up

Once you’ve got a few services humming along and you’re comfortable with your setup, you might find yourself needing more resources. At this point, consider:

- Adding more servers for additional workloads.
- Experimenting with clustering using Kubernetes or other orchestration tools.
- Diving into advanced networking concepts like VLANs and firewalls.

Your homelab evolves as you do. That’s the beauty of it. It grows with your skills, interests, and ambitions.
