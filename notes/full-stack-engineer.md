What is a full-stack engineer?

Traditionally, I would say that a full-stack engineer was able to work across the entire software "stack" -- from the code the software is written in to the servers the software is running on.

Today, I would say something different. From watching Google rise, I'm a firm believer that if you change the way we find information, you'll change our behavior and elevate the level of things we work on.

Stone to books, books to webpages, and now AI.

"2025 is the year of AI Agents"

With a possibly naive take, I think the software stack will (and should!) collapse. We don't need to write code a thousand different ways anymore. Lots of problems have been solved in the last 30 years and coming into the industry, it looks like a bunch of people just spinning their wheels.

I probably won't sign up for another non-AI SaaS for the next year.

Anyways, a full-stack engineer can write a little code, make a small PCB, and wire it up to complete the task. Think of all the advancements in 3d printing over the last decade+.

If you know how to code, and aren't 100% committed to the career (why did we do this?), I think now is the best time to switch it up. These jobs are opening up fast and will close faster.
