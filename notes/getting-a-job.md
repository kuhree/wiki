## Overview

Some basic things:

- Talk to people. Everyone you know, should know you're looking for a role.
  Don't be pushy, just inform, often return a favor in exchange for time.

- Apply habitually. You probably won't get the 1st, 2nd, or 30th job you apply for.
  Make it a habit to be applying to jobs. And track them, just don't drive yourself crazy.

- Make it easy to change your Resume/Cover Letter. Yes, have a cover letter.
  Write it once in Text, transform it to your formats. Or cloud.
