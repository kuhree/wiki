idk why, but I wanted to see different "Hello, Worlds" in the programming languages I'm using/considering.

In a way, I wanted to see what it felt like to start a "project" and build it, then run it.

## C

I don't know C, but it seems like a natural choice for gamedev so I'm looking into it. It started this note.

I had trouble with `gcc` but that's likely user error on my part with the recent [[nixos]] install. `cc` did fine and was already installed.

I'm both a fan and also terrified by the syntax, taking me back.

I need to look into the tooling a bit more I think.

Look at the opening bracket, that was recommended. I'm not doing that.

## Rust

Never tried rust either. Another inspiration for this waste of time.

It feels, clean. But like in a magical way. That `println!`, the `!`, means it's a [macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html). whatever the fuck that is (it expands into source code when compiling, meta-programming.). Reminds me of ruby? but systems level.

Sounds cool, but it's already over my head. I love the docs though, so maybe it just takes time.

## Go

I've been [[learning-go]] off and on for roughly the past year. It's a neat language.

I kinda love it for very specific usecases.

Serving JS apps, scripting that I want to distribute that's more complicated than bash, utilities.

I find Go a very utility first language. Some magic, but it's all under your fingertips.

## JS (Typescript)

One of these is not like the rest huh.

I've been on the bun train since just before 1.0. They hooked me on the typescript. I stayed for the builtin plugin manager, "faster" runtime, and neat features (command line parsing).

It's fine, it works. It gets a job done.
