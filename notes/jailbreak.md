## Jailbreak

To jailbreak a device, is to escape the general restraints of the device from the manufacturer and allow the user to run custom code.

Almost anything can be "jailbroken", but most commonly I've seen
- mobile phones - iPhone/Android
- consoles - PS3/PS4, X360/Xbone
- home appliances - think "smart" devices
- Electric vehicles - this one's pretty new for me
