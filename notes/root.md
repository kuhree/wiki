## Root Access

Most [[operating-system|operating systems]] have a `root` or `admin` user that have special _privileges_ that allow them to do things a regular user would not. They are given more access to the underlying [[operating-system]] and therefore granted more freedom to tell the computer what to do -- even to the detriment of the computer itself.

Such things like
- deleting special and/or required files
- managing applications
- reinstall/replace the current [[operating-system]].
