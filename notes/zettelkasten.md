## Zettelkasten

### Introduction

Zettelkasten translates to 'slip box' in German and was originally a filing cabinet of index cards devised by Niklas Luhmann.

It's his system for organizing these notes in such a way that each idea was small enough to fin on a 4"x6" index card. The card has to be useful in isolation, and would be linked to other cards in the system.

With digital not-taking systems, the physical organization and numbering system is less important as you can digitally link notes together. <small>thanks obsidian!</small>
