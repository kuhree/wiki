Hike for Life is a company leading guided hiking experiences throughout the beautiful scenery in Colorado Springs.

Hike for Life provides custom guided hiking experience that required a revision to their booking platform in order to accommodate new growth in their market.

In addition to a site redesign, they needed some business-specific needs met as far as scheduling goes. Ultimately, they needed a way for customers to book an appointment, and for this appointment to be automatically scheduled, assigned a guide, and placed on the team calandar. For this project, I partnered with a local design, Josh and we got to work. Over the summer the site saw an increase in both traffic and total bookings. The team was happy with the improved workflow and Josh and I learned a lot.
